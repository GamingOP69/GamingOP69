## About Me

I’m **Samrat**, a developer who enjoys building systems that are simple on the surface, solid underneath, and practical in the real world.

I care about **clean architecture**, **readable code**, and **long-term maintainability** more than quick hacks. Most of my work revolves around turning ideas into usable products — whether that’s a game plugin, a backend service, or a mobile app.

- **Location:** Nepal  
- **Primary Focus:** Web Development, Java (Minecraft), Android  
- **Approach:** Learn deeply, build thoughtfully, improve continuously

- **Minecraft Plugins & Tools**  
  Custom server features, gameplay systems, and performance-aware plugins using Java (Spigot/Bukkit).

- **Web Applications**  
  Full-stack projects with clean frontends and well-structured backend APIs.

- **Android Applications**  
  Real-world apps with practical UX, maintainable codebases, and modern tooling.

- **Automation & Utilities**  
  Small tools and scripts that remove friction and save time.
