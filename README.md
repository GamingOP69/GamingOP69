About Me

I'm Samrat, a software developer from Nepal who builds practical, scalable software with clean architecture. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, whether it's a Minecraft plugin streamlining server management or a web app simplifying a workflow.

I believe in understanding the fundamentals deeply, which lets me adapt and learn new tools quickly. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me experimenting with new tech, reading about system design, or contributing to open-source projects.

What I Build

I focus on creating software that's both functional and maintainable:

· Minecraft Plugins & Tools – Custom server systems, performance optimizations, and gameplay enhancements using Java and Spigot/Bukkit APIs
· Web Applications – Full-stack projects with responsive frontends and robust backend APIs
· Android Applications – Native mobile apps with clean UI patterns and offline capabilities
· Automation Scripts – Tools that simplify repetitive tasks and improve development workflows

Featured Projects

Most of my work lives on GitHub. Here are a few areas I focus on:

· Minecraft Development – High-performance plugins with configuration systems, API integrations, and custom gameplay mechanics
· Web Applications – Full-stack projects with modern frameworks, RESTful APIs, and responsive design
· Android Applications – Published apps following Material Design guidelines with efficient data handling

You can explore all my repositories on GitHub. I maintain both production-ready projects and experimental prototypes.

Experience & Approach

With over three years of Java development, I've built systems ranging from Minecraft server ecosystems to backend services. My Python work typically involves automation and tooling, while my Android projects focus on creating intuitive user experiences.

I prioritize:

· Clean, readable code that's easy to maintain
· Thoughtful architecture that scales appropriately
· Practical solutions over over-engineered ones
· Continuous learning to stay current with best practices
